# Beatles-Cosine-Similarity-
In this project, I used cosine similarity to determine if the lyrics to In My Life, a disputed song from band members John Lennon and Paul McCartney who both claimed to be the primary composer


The song writing collaboration between John Lennon and Paul McCartney was one of the most productive in music history. Unlike many other partnerships where one individual wrote lyrics and one wrote music, Lennon and McCartney composed both, and it was decided that any song that was written would be credited to both. In the beginning of their relationship, many of their songs were collaborations. However, later on, they often worked separately with little to no input from the other.

Because of extensive reporting on the Beatles over the years, it is generally known if a Lennon-McCartney song was a true collaboration, primarily (or totally) written by Lennon, or primarily (or totally) written by McCartney.

However, there are several disputed songs where both Lennon and McCartney at times claimed to be the sole (or primary) composer.

Here I use cosine similarity to determine if In My Life (disputed) is most similar to From Me to You (collaboration, not disputed), Strawberry Fields (Lennon, not disputed) or Penny Lane (McCartney, not disputed).
